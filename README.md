# Haskell-s-study-note
when I learn Haskell write some good examples to remember  some special 


# in Haskell every expression and function must return something

# list opretor
first-element's order number is 0
++ add list from left to the end
: instanuously add list or just some expression in list
!! get something out of list (<list> !! <order number>)
there is a example show what different : ++ in haskell and how to use it smart
1:[]:[1,2,3] it's wrong but 1:[]++[1,2,3] it's true
list can be compared if the element in list can be compared
*head <list>* take a list and return its head
